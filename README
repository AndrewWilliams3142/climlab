Python code package for simple climate modeling

To install:
python setup.py

The directory courseware/ contains a collection of IPython notebooks (.ipynb)
used for teaching some basics of climate science, 
and documenting use of the climlab package.
These should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g:
ipython notebook Insolation.ipynb

The code and notebooks were originally developed in winter / spring 2014
in support of an undergraduate course at the University at Albany.

to do:
- clean up ebm.py to play better with orbital code (don't load the orbital table repeatedly)
- create a superclass for a time-stepping model that is used by both
column.py and ebm.py
- add options for spectral bands to column.py
