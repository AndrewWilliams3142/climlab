Python code package for simple climate modeling
Brian E. J. Rose
Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences
University at Albany
brose@albany.edu

To install:
python setup.py

The directory courseware/ contains a collection of IPython notebooks (.ipynb)
used for teaching some basics of climate science, 
and documenting use of the climlab package.
These should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g:
ipython notebook Insolation.ipynb

The code and notebooks were originally developed in winter / spring 2014
in support of an undergraduate course at the University at Albany.
See the original course webpage at

to do:
- add more flexible superstructure for timestepping with different averaging and diagnostics
- add options for spectral bands to column.py
- develop more courseware content, particularly to document EBM features.
