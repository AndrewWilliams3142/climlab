Installation
----------------
``python setup.py``

    or

``python setup.py develop``


Example usage
------------------
The directory courseware/ contains a collection of IPython notebooks (.ipynb)
used for teaching some basics of climate science, 
and documenting use of the climlab package.
These should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g:
ipython notebook Insolation.ipynb

History
----------------------
The code and notebooks were originally developed in winter / spring 2014
in support of an undergraduate course at the University at Albany.
See the original course webpage at
http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV480_Spring2014/

The package was completely redesigned around an object-oriented modeling 
framework in January 2015.
