Tutorials
=========

For a learning-by-doing approach, a couple of Tutorials come with the `climlab` package. They can be found in the package's `courseware` folder. They are in the Jupyter Notebook format. These Notebooks have been used for teaching some basics of climate science and had also the initial purpose to document the ``climlab`` package.


**Example usage**

The notebooks are self-describing, and should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g:

	.. code-block:: console
	
		jupyter notebook Insolation.ipynb
