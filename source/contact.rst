climlab documentation
#####################

The documentation has been built by Moritz Kreuzer using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_.
Based on some commentary strings in the source code and a couple of Jupyter Notebooks, this documentation has been developed.

Currently it covers only the Energy Balance Model relevant parts of the package.
