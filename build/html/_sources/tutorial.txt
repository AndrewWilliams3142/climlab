Tutorials
=========

For a learning-by-doing approach, a couple of Tutorials come with the `climlab` package. They can be found in the package's `courseware` folder and are written in the Jupyter Notebook format. The first `climlab` notebooks have been used for teaching some basics of climate science and had also the initial purpose to document the ``climlab`` package. [#]_

 


**Example usage**

The notebooks are self-describing, and should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g.:

	.. code-block:: console
	
		jupyter notebook Insolation.ipynb


**Notebooks**

A few notebooks which describe the basic usage of EBMs can be found here:

   notebooks/Budyko_Transport_EBM.ipynb

.. notebooks/Insolation.ipynb
   notebooks/Seasonal_cycle_and_heat_capacity.ipynb
   notebooks/Snowball_Earth_in_the_EBM.ipynb


.. [#] As this documentation is part of a bachelor thesis, only tutorials by Moritz Kreuzer have been included in this version. In the future online version of the documentation there will be more tutorials included.
